# Data Ingestion Pipeline Template

This repository consists of boilerplate folder structure to write and organize your scripts for a data ingestion pipeline

## Folder Structure
The tree diagram below represents a general file structure

```

     |--- deploy                            # pipeline orchestration and configuration of DAGs
     |    |---dev

## Different Blocks of ETL pipeline
1. Scraping/Data Harvesting
    - Contains all the scripts that extracts metadata and raw data to be processed further from database, websites, webservices, APIs, etc.
2. Cleaning
    - Treatment missing fields and values
    - Conversion of amounts to USD
    - Treatment of duplicate entries
    - Convert country codes to `ISO 3166-1 alpha3` i.e. 3 letter format
    - Identify region name and region code using the country code
3. Geocoding
    - Based upon location information available in the data
        - Location label
        - Geo-spatial coordinates
    - Missing field can be found either by using geocoding or reverse geocoding with max precision available
4. Standardization
    - Fields to be strictly in **lower snake casing**
    - Taking care of data types and consistency of fields
    - Standardize fields like `sector` and `subsector`
    - Mapping of `status` and `stage`
    - Renaming of field names as per required standards
    - Manipulation of certain fields and values to meet up the global standards for presentation, analytics and business use of data
    - Refer to the [Global Field Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sbb7GxhpPBE4ohW6YQEakvrEkkFSwvUrXnmG4P_B0OI/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet for the standards to be followed

### Note
> Depending upon what fields are already available in the data `GEOCODING` step may or may not be required.

> It is recommended that the resultant data after each and every step is stored and backed up for recovery purpose.

> Apart from the primary fields listed down in [Global Field Standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sbb7GxhpPBE4ohW6YQEakvrEkkFSwvUrXnmG4P_B0OI/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet, there are several other secondary fields that are to be scraped; given by the data provider for every document that holds significant business importance.

## Get started with
- Fork the repository by clicking the `Fork` button on top right-hand side corner of the page.
- After creating fork repo, create a branch in that repo and finally create a `PULL REQUEST` from fork repo branch to the main branch in upstream branch of root repo.


### Submission and Evaluation
- For assignment submission guidelines and evaluation criteria refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/Taiyo-ai/pt-mesh-pipeline/wiki) documentation
